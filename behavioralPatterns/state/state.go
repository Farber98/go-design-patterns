/*
STATE: Directly related to FSM.

OBJECTIVE:
- Develop FSM
- Have a type that alters its own behavior when some internal things have changed.
- Model compÄºex graphs and pipelines can be upgraded easily by adding more states and rerouting their output states.

EXAMPLE: Guess number name,
- Number guessing game where we'll have to guess some number between 0 and 10 with few attempts.


ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Game will ask the player how many tries they will have before losing the game.
- The number to guess must be between 0 and 10.
- Every time a player enters a number to guess, the number of retries drop by one.
- If the number of retries reaches zero and the number is still incorrect, the game finishes and the players has lost.
- If the player guesses the number, the player wins.
